# project-3: Supervised Learning (Linear Regression)

## Overview
This project applies supervised learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to analyze used device data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the value of used devices based on their features.

## Project Structure
- **Supervised learning-Linear_regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing detailed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and linear regression implementation steps.
- **used_device_data.csv**: Dataset containing information about used devices (e.g., specifications, condition, and price).
- **README.md**: Documentation on project purpose, requirements, and usage guidelines.

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**:
   - Python 3.x
   - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

2. **Set up environment** (example with pip):
```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Supervised learning-Linear_regression.ipynb`).
   2. Restart the kernel and run all cells sequentially.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Reads and cleans the used device dataset.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Uses summary statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.
3. **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
4. **Linear Regression**: Builds and evaluates a regression model to predict device prices.

## Results & Insights
- The linear regression model identifies key factors influencing the price of used devices.
- Insights from the analysis can help sellers price their devices competitively and buyers make informed decisions.

## Contributing
Contributions in the form of issue reports or suggestions are welcome.
